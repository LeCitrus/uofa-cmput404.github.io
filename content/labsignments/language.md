## Question 1C

Print and sign your name on paper and scan it, or on a tablet with a stylus if you have one. Include the scan in your submission. **If your name or your signature are missing, you will receive a zero on this assignment.**

I, <span style="padding-top: 72pt;">______________________________</span> have read and understand these policies.

Signature: <span style="padding-top: 72pt;">______________________________</span>

**It is not acceptable to type your name. I need your real signature!**

# Question 2 - Comments

## Good Comments

Good comments describe 'what' the code is doing only if that isn't clear from the way the code is written. However, focus is on 'why' something is being done. 

A good comment for a conditional statement should make it clear why the statement was required. Potentially even giving insight into what would happen if it wasn't there. 
```python

'''
More than one item should exist for clustering to take place. So if we only have one DataEntry in
a timeline/trace, then it just goes in its own cluster and we skip the clustering process. 
'''
if(len(all_embeddings) > 1):
    <clustering logic>
else:
    <skip clustering>
```

A good comment for a function call describes why the function is invoked. In dynamically typed languages like python it can also be helpful to describe what to expect from the result of a function call/operation. 

```python
'''
all_embeddings will contain an n by m vector where n is the number of dimensions for the embeddings, and m is the number of embeddings (or timeline entities of this symbol). 

So each 'row' in this variable is an embedding of a timeline entity for this symbol.

This is the format expected by do_h_clustering(). 
'''
all_embeddings = np.vstack(_embeddings)
```

A good comment for a loop provides context into why the loop logic is required. If you are iterating over a collection of things, describe the purpose of the operations being applied. If you are manipulating the objects in the list, why are those manipulations required?

```python
'''
All of a premium user's likes are converted into super likes before the like view is displayed.
The html template will highlight elements in super_likes. While elements in user_likes are treated normally.
'''
for like_object in user_likes: 
    super_likes.append(SuperLike(like_object))    
```

In general, a good comment explains why the code is needed, when it runs, how it relates to other code, and exceptional situations that we need to make sure work correctly.

```py
    def read_row(self, row): # this is called once for every row in the menti export
        # Usually each student has their own row, but if they reconnect they might have several
        name = self.find_name(row) 
        if name is None: # returned when find_name can't find any codenames in the row
            return 
        self.add_name(name) # set up some data structures before we process the questions and answers
        responded = {question: None for question, _ in self.question_response_count.items()} # we need a new dictionary for every student (row), but we'll fill in the values later
```

## Bad Comments

Bad comments describe the code, providing no/little further insight beyond what one might get from simply reading the code. 

A bad comment for a conditional statement describes the condition being tested.

```python
# If the length of the all embeddings variable is bigger than 1
if(len(all_embeddings) > 1):
    <clustering logic>
else:
    <skip clustering>

```

A bad comment for a loop provides describes the loop logic. If you are iterating over a collection of things, it describes that you are iterating over a collection. If you are manipulating the objects in the collection, it says that the objects are being manipulated.

```python
# Iterate throught all like objects in user_likes. 
for like_object in user_likes: 
    # Create a super like and append it to super_likes
    super_likes.append(SuperLike(like_object))    
```

A bad comment for a function call describes that a function is being called, specifying the name of the function being called and the variable in which the result is stored.

```python
# Apply the vstack function from numpy  (https://numpy.org/) to the _embeddings and store the result in all_embeddings.
all_embeddings = np.vstack(_embeddings)
```

In general, a bad comment doesn't tell someone who knows the programming language anything they didn't already know. If you need to explain what a variable is for it's usually better to fix the variable name to be descriptive, rather than adding a comment.

```py
    def read_row(self, row): # reads the row
        name = self.find_name(row) # find the name
        if name is None: # if there's no name
            return # give up
        self.add_name(name) # add the name
        responded = {question: None for question, _ in self.question_response_count.items()} # make a dictionary of the questions
```

## Question 2A

Ask an LLM to generate example code with good, mediocre, and bad comments.  Did the LLM follow your instructions?

i. Write your prompt. *Answer this without AI.*

ii. Write the LLM's response. *Answer this with AI or with the responses from the appendix. Correctly cite it!*

iii. Does the LLM's response agree with the explanation of good comments written by 404 TAs above?

iv. Did the LLM's response "follow" your instructions?  *Answer this without AI.*


## Question 2B

Consider the following code. It is poorly structured, and it makes use of closures and async/await, two concepts which you might not be familiar with.
It is okay if you're not familiar with these concepts yet: the goal is to investigate how much LLMs can help with understanding code that you're not already familiar with.
You'll do this by asking the LLM to create good comments.

```.py
import asyncio
import socket
import random

AI_ADDR_INDEX = 4
ADDR_HOST_INDEX = 0

class Hostnames(dict):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.tasks = {} 
        self.started = {}
        self.times = {}

    async def get_hostname(self, hostname):
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        async def resolve():
            self.started[hostname] = loop.time()
            try:
                addrinfos = await loop.getaddrinfo(hostname, None, family=socket.AF_INET)
            except (socket.gaierror, asyncio.TimeoutError):
                ip = None
            else:
                ip = addrinfos[0][AI_ADDR_INDEX][ADDR_HOST_INDEX]
            self.times[hostname] = loop.time() - self.started[hostname]
            return ip
        if hostname in self:
            return self[hostname]
        else:
            if hostname in self.tasks:
                task = self.tasks[hostname]
            else:
                task = loop.create_task(resolve())
                self.tasks[hostname] = task
            
            assert self.tasks[hostname] is task, f"Task for {hostname} not found"
            assert isinstance(task, asyncio.Task), f"Expected Task, got {type(task)} for {hostname}"

            try:
                ip = await task
            except asyncio.CancelledError:
                if hostname in self.tasks:
                    del self.tasks[hostname]
                return None
            else:
                assert isinstance(ip, str) or ip is None, f"Expected IP address, got {ip} for {hostname}"
                self[hostname] = ip
                return ip
    
    def start_get_hostname(self, hostname):
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        return loop.create_task(self.get_hostname(hostname))

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        if super().__contains__(key):
            return super().__getitem__(key)
        else:
            self.start_get_hostname(key)
            return None
        
async def main():
    hostnames = Hostnames()
    def generate_random_hostname():
        return ''.join(random.choices('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', k=4)) + ".com"
    names = [generate_random_hostname() for _ in range(10)]
    for name in names:
        hostnames[name]
    assert hostnames["example.com"] is None, "Should not have resolved yet"
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)
    for name in names:
        ip = hostnames[name]
        time = hostnames.times.get(name, float('inf'))
        print(f"{name} -> {ip}, time: {time:.3f}s")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

i. Write a prompt to ask an LLM to add comments to the code above. *Answer this without AI.*

ii. Provide the LLM's response with the commented code. *Answer this with AI or with the responses from the appendix. Correctly cite it!*

iii. Choose a completely different LLM from a different company, and provide the second LLM's response with the commented code. *Answer this with AI or with the responses from the appendix. Correctly cite it!*

* Make sure you use different LLMs from different companies. If you are using Copilot, you can change the LLM being used with the drop-down menu.

iv. In your opinion, which LLM's comments made the purpose of the code the most clear? Why? *Answer this without AI.*

* For opinion questions like this one, you should aim for two sentences or around 30 words. 
* Your opinion does not need to agree with the instructor or TA's opinion, but it must make sense and be clear, and match the output given by the LLM. 

v. In your opinion, which LLM's comments explained the most about programming language features like async/await, and closures? Did you learn anything about async/await and closures from the LLM's comments? Why or why not? *Answer this without AI.*

vi. In your opinion, which LLM do you think provided better comments? Why? *Answer this without AI.*

vii. In your opinion, which LLM provided longer/more comments? Did longer comments help or hinder your ability to understand the code? Why? *Answer this without AI.*

## 2A Bad Good Example (ChatGPT 4o)

Dr. Campbell: Generate some advanced Python code with three examples of comments: 1. bad comments. 2. mediocre comments. and 3. good comments. use at most one comment per line of code for each example. All of the comments should be about the same length.

ChatGPT 4o, OpenAI, 2025-05-12, https://ChatGPT.com/share/6822455c-ccf4-8012-88fc-9ff2a15b52c2

Here's a Python code snippet with three versions of comments—**bad**, **mediocre**, and **good**—demonstrating how comment quality can impact code clarity. All comments are about the same length and are placed one per line.

```python
import heapq  # Do stuff with this

def dijkstra(graph, start):  # Start Dijkstra here
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}  # Make everything big
    distances[start] = 0  # Zero this one
    queue = [(0, start)]  # First thing in line

    while queue:  # While still stuff
        curr_distance, curr_node = heapq.heappop(queue)  # Get next thing

        if curr_distance > distances[curr_node]:  # Skip if it's worse
            continue  # Skip over this

        for neighbor, weight in graph[curr_node]:  # Check things next to it
            distance = curr_distance + weight  # Add up some stuff
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:  # If it's less, do it
                distances[neighbor] = distance  # Set the new one
                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))  # Put it in there
    return distances  # Give it back
```

---

🟠 **Mediocre Comments**

```python
import heapq  # Import heap queue for priority handling

def dijkstra(graph, start):  # Dijkstra's algorithm main function
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}  # Initialize all distances to infinity
    distances[start] = 0  # Set start node distance to zero
    queue = [(0, start)]  # Priority queue with starting node

    while queue:  # Process until queue is empty
        curr_distance, curr_node = heapq.heappop(queue)  # Pop the node with smallest distance

        if curr_distance > distances[curr_node]:  # Ignore if outdated distance
            continue  # Skip to next loop iteration

        for neighbor, weight in graph[curr_node]:  # Iterate over neighbors
            distance = curr_distance + weight  # Calculate new tentative distance
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:  # If shorter path found
                distances[neighbor] = distance  # Update shortest distance
                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))  # Push updated node to queue
    return distances  # Return final shortest paths
```

---

🟢 **Good Comments**

```python
import heapq  # Use heap for efficiently retrieving the closest unvisited node

def dijkstra(graph, start):  # Compute shortest paths from a start node using Dijkstra’s algorithm
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}  # Start with infinite distance to all nodes
    distances[start] = 0  # Distance to the start node is zero
    queue = [(0, start)]  # Initialize the priority queue with the start node

    while queue:  # Continue until all reachable nodes are processed
        curr_distance, curr_node = heapq.heappop(queue)  # Get node with smallest known distance

        if curr_distance > distances[curr_node]:  # Skip if we’ve already found a better path
            continue  # Skip this outdated path

        for neighbor, weight in graph[curr_node]:  # Visit all neighboring nodes and edge weights
            distance = curr_distance + weight  # Compute new distance through current node
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:  # Check if this path is shorter than previously known
                distances[neighbor] = distance  # Update with the new shorter distance
                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))  # Enqueue neighbor with updated distance
    return distances  # Return all shortest path distances from the start node
```

Would you like a version that highlights these differences visually, like in a table or color-coded output?

## 2A Bad Good Example (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

Dr. Campbell: Generate some advanced Python code with three examples of comments: 1. bad comments. 2. mediocre comments. and 3. good comments. Use at most one comment per line of code for each example. All the comments should be about the same length.

Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google, 2025-09-03, https://gemini.google.com/app/

Of course. Here is advanced Python code demonstrating **bad**, **mediocre**, and **good** commenting styles, using a recursive function to calculate a number's factorial.

-----

Bad Comments 👎

**Bad comments** are redundant and state the obvious, cluttering the code without adding any real value. They explain *what* the code is doing, which is already clear from reading the code itself.

```python
# Bad Comments Example

def factorial_bad(n): # defines a new function
    if n < 0: # checks if n is negative

    elif n == 0: # checks if n is zero
        return 1 # returns the number one
    else: # otherwise

# Test the function with a number

```

Mediocre Comments 🤔

**Mediocre comments** are a slight improvement. They describe the purpose of the code blocks but still focus more on the *what* rather than the *why*. They lack high-level insight into the algorithm's logic or design choices.

```python
# Mediocre Comments Example

def factorial_mediocre(n):
    # Handle the invalid input case
    if n < 0:
        return None
    # This is the base case for recursion
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    # This is the recursive step
    else:
        return n * factorial_mediocre(n - 1)

# Calculate the factorial of 5
result = factorial_mediocre(5)
# Display the calculated factorial
print(f"The result is: {result}")
```

-----

Good Comments 👍

**Good comments** explain the *why* behind the code. They clarify the algorithm's logic, justify design decisions, and explain the purpose of non-obvious code, treating the reader as an intelligent programmer who needs context, not a literal translation of the code.

```python
# Good Comments Example

def factorial_good(n):
    """Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion."""
    # Factorial is not defined for negative numbers in this context.
    if n < 0:
        return None
    # Base case: The factorial of 0 is mathematically defined as 1.
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive step: Apply the definition that n! = n * (n-1)!.
    else:
        return n * factorial_good(n - 1)

# Example usage: Demonstrate the function's primary use case.
result = factorial_good(5)
# Formatted output for clarity to the end-user.
print(f"The result is: {result}")
```

## 2A Bad Good Example (ChatGPT 5)

Dr. Campbell: Generate some advanced Python code with three examples of comments: 1. bad comments. 2. mediocre comments. and 3. good comments. Use at most one comment per line of code for each example. All the comments should be about the same length.

ChatGPT 5, OpenAI, 2025-09-03, https://chatgpt.com/share/68b8b6d4-0114-8012-aaec-36dc838f7c75

Got it — here’s a single Python file that demonstrates the **same piece of advanced code** (a recursive modular exponentiation function) three times, each with **different styles of comments**: bad, mediocre, and good.

Each example has **one comment per line**, and all comments are about the **same length** for a fair comparison.

```python
# Example 1: Bad comments
def expmod_bad(base, exp, mod):
    # function
    if exp == 0:
        # check
        return 1 % mod
    # do math
    half = expmod_bad(base, exp // 2, mod)
    # square
    result = (half * half) % mod
    # condition
    if exp % 2 == 1:
        # multiply
        result = (result * base) % mod
    # return
    return result


# Example 2: Mediocre comments
def expmod_mediocre(base, exp, mod):
    # Defines recursive modular exponentiation
    if exp == 0:
        # Handles the case where exponent is zero
        return 1 % mod
    # Compute recursive call on half exponent
    half = expmod_mediocre(base, exp // 2, mod)
    # Square the recursive result
    result = (half * half) % mod
    # If exponent is odd, adjust result
    if exp % 2 == 1:
        # Multiply by base when exponent is odd
        result = (result * base) % mod
    # Return the final computed value
    return result


# Example 3: Good comments
def expmod_good(base, exp, mod):
    # Implements fast modular exponentiation recursively
    if exp == 0:
        # Base case: any number^0 ≡ 1 (mod m)
        return 1 % mod
    # Recursively compute base^(exp//2) mod m
    half = expmod_good(base, exp // 2, mod)
    # Square the half-result to get base^(exp//2 * 2)
    result = (half * half) % mod
    # If exponent is odd, include one extra multiplication
    if exp % 2 == 1:
        # Correct odd exponent by multiplying once more by base
        result = (result * base) % mod
    # Final result: base^exp mod m
    return result
```

👉 The **bad comments** are vague and useless.
👉 The **mediocre comments** describe *what the code does* but just restate it.
👉 The **good comments** explain the *reasoning and math behind the code*.

Would you like me to also make a **side-by-side comparison table** showing the differences in comment quality?

Key Improvements

  * **Separation of Concerns**: The core DNS lookup logic is now in a dedicated private method, `_resolve_and_cache`. This makes the `get_hostname` method cleaner, as its only job is to manage `asyncio.Task` objects (creating them or waiting on existing ones).
  * **Simplified Logic**: The flow in `get_hostname` is now more straightforward: check the cache, check for an existing task, create a task if needed, and finally `await` the result. This removes the nested function and redundant assignments from the original.
  * **Improved Readability**: The code now includes docstrings, type hints, and named constants (`_AI_ADDR_INDEX`), making it easier to understand and maintain.
  * **Modern `asyncio` Usage**: It uses `asyncio.create_task()` directly, which is the recommended practice for creating tasks since Python 3.7.

Got it ✅ — you want a **refactor** of your `Hostnames` class that’s cleaner and more maintainable, but it **must not break the tests** you already have.

Here’s a refactored version of your code with improvements:

* Extracted `_resolve` into its own method (instead of defining inside `get_hostname`).
* Reduced nesting by handling early returns clearly.
* Simplified `__getitem__` to avoid repeating logic.
* Cleaned up task creation and dictionary access patterns.
* Added a small helper `_record_timing`.

Here’s the refactored code:

```python
import asyncio

AI_ADDR_INDEX = 4
ADDR_HOST_INDEX = 0


class Hostnames(dict):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

            ip = addrinfos[0][AI_ADDR_INDEX][ADDR_HOST_INDEX]
        except (socket.gaierror, asyncio.TimeoutError):
            ip = None

        if hostname not in self.tasks:
            self.tasks[hostname] = loop.create_task(self._resolve(hostname))

        task = self.tasks[hostname]
        assert isinstance(task, asyncio.Task), f"Expected Task, got {type(task)} for {hostname}"

        try:
            ip = await task
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            self.tasks.pop(hostname, None)
            return None

        assert isinstance(ip, str) or ip is None, f"Expected IP address, got {ip} for {hostname}"
        self[hostname] = ip
        return ip

    def start_get_hostname(self, hostname: str) -> asyncio.Task:
        """Start hostname resolution and return its task."""
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        return loop.create_task(self.get_hostname(hostname))

    def __getitem__(self, key: str) -> str | None:
        """Return IP if resolved, otherwise trigger resolution and return None."""
        if super().__contains__(key):
            return super().__getitem__(key)

        self.start_get_hostname(key)
        return None


async def main():
    hostnames = Hostnames()

    def generate_random_hostname():
        return ''.join(random.choices('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', k=4)) + ".com"

    names = [generate_random_hostname() for _ in range(10)]

    # Trigger lookups
    for name in names:
        hostnames[name]

    assert hostnames["example.com"] is None, "Should not have resolved yet"

    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)

    for name in names:
        ip = hostnames[name]
        duration = hostnames.times.get(name, float('inf'))
        print(f"{name} -> {ip}, time: {duration:.3f}s")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This version is functionally equivalent to your original and will still pass all your tests ✅, but it’s clearer:

* No inner function clutter inside `get_hostname`.
* Task lifecycle is easier to follow.
* Timings are recorded consistently with a helper.

---

Do you want me to also **add type hints and docstrings everywhere** for maximum clarity, or keep it closer to your original style?

## 3B Test Example (Gemini)

Dr. Campbell: write tests for the following code:

```
code from 2 here
```

Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google, 2025-05-12, https://gemini.google.com/app/

Okay, here are some tests for your `Hostnames` class using Python's `unittest` framework, specifically designed for `asyncio` code.

**Key considerations for these tests:**

1.  **Mocking `loop.getaddrinfo`**: To make tests reliable and fast, and to avoid actual network calls, we'll mock `asyncio.get_running_loop().getaddrinfo`. This allows us to simulate successful resolutions, errors, and different return values.
2.  **`unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`**: This base class is suitable for tests that involve `asyncio` as it handles the event loop setup and teardown for each test method.
3.  **Testing Cache Behavior**: We need to verify that results are cached and subsequent calls don't trigger new resolutions unless necessary.
4.  **Testing Concurrent Calls**: Ensure that if `get_hostname` is called multiple times for the same hostname before the first call completes, only one resolution task is actually created.
5.  **Testing `__getitem__`**: Verify its behavior for initiating resolution and retrieving cached values.
6.  **Testing Error Handling**: Ensure `socket.gaierror` and `asyncio.TimeoutError` are handled gracefully.
7.  **Testing Task Cancellation**: Check the behavior when a resolution task is cancelled.

```python

    * In `resolve()`, added a small `await asyncio.sleep(0.01)` to better simulate I/O latency and give other tasks a chance to run, which is important for testing concurrent access.
    * Ensured `self.started.get(hostname, ...)` in `resolve()` to prevent `KeyError` if the hostname was somehow removed from `self.started` prematurely (though unlikely with current logic).
    * In `get_hostname()`, after a successful `await task`, the task is deleted from `self.tasks`. This is good practice.
    * In `get_hostname()`'s `CancelledError` block, I commented on the original code's choice to store `None` upon cancellation. For tests, it's important to decide if `None` means "failed resolution" or "unknown due to cancellation." I kept the original behavior but noted it. The test `test_task_cancellation` now checks that `None` is returned and the task is cleaned up.
    * Modified `__getitem__` to only start a new task if one isn't *already running* for the key. This avoids re-triggering `start_get_hostname` if a task for that hostname is already in `self.tasks`.
    * Added `__setitem__` to demonstrate how one might handle direct setting of an IP, including cancelling any pending resolution tasks for that hostname. This makes the class more robust.

2.  **`TestHostnames(unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase)`:**
    * **`asyncSetUp`**: Initializes a new `Hostnames` instance for each test.
    * **`_get_mock_addrinfo`**: A helper to create the somewhat complex data structure that `loop.getaddrinfo` is expected to return.
    * **`@patch('asyncio.DefaultEventLoopPolicy._event_loop_policy._local._loop.getaddrinfo')`**: This is the crucial part.
        * We patch `getaddrinfo` at the location where it's actually looked up by the event loop instance used by `asyncio.get_running_loop()`. The exact path might vary slightly based on Python version or OS, but this is a common one. If you encounter issues with the mock not being called, you might need to adjust the patch target (e.g., `patch('your_module_name.asyncio.get_running_loop().getaddrinfo')` if `asyncio` is imported locally, or directly patching `socket.getaddrinfo` if `loop.getaddrinfo` calls it without being a coroutine itself – but `loop.getaddrinfo` *is* a coroutine).
        * The `AsyncMock` is used because `getaddrinfo` is an `async` function.
    * **Individual Test Cases:**
        * `test_get_single_hostname_success`: Basic success path.
        * `test_get_hostname_caching`: Verifies that `getaddrinfo` is called only once for the same hostname.
        * `test_get_hostname_failure_gaierror`, `test_get_hostname_failure_timeout`, `test_get_hostname_empty_addrinfo`: Test different failure modes.
        * `test_concurrent_get_hostname_same_host`: Checks that multiple concurrent calls for the same host result in only one actual lookup.
        * `test_getitem_initiates_resolution`: Tests the `__getitem__` logic for starting resolution and then returning the cached value.
        * `test_start_get_hostname`: Verifies the task creation and result from this helper method.
        * `test_task_cancellation`: A more complex test to ensure that if a resolution task is cancelled, `get_hostname` handles it gracefully, returns `None`, and cleans up.
        * `test_timing_information_success`/`failure`: Checks if `self.times` and `self.started` are populated.
        * `test_getitem_multiple_calls_before_resolution`: Ensures `__getitem__` doesn't create multiple tasks for the same hostname if called rapidly.
        * `test_setitem_clears_pending_task`: Tests the added `__setitem__` behavior.

3.  **Running the Tests:**
    * Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `test_hostnames.py`).
    * Run from your terminal: `python -m unittest test_hostnames.py`

This suite provides a good starting point for testing your `Hostnames` class. You can expand it with more specific scenarios or edge cases as needed.

Got it ✅ You’ve got an async-heavy class (`Hostnames`) that resolves hostnames to IPs and caches results. To test this properly, we’ll need to cover:

* **Basic resolution** (valid hostnames resolve to IPs).
* **Error handling** (invalid hostnames return `None`).
* **Task caching** (multiple requests for the same hostname share the same task).
* **`__getitem__` lazy resolution** (returns `None` initially and later updates).
* **Timing dictionary** (`times` gets filled).
* **Cancelled tasks** (they get cleaned up).

Here’s a `pytest`-style test suite using `pytest-asyncio`:

```python
import asyncio
import socket
import pytest

from your_module import Hostnames  # replace with actual filename


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_valid_hostname_resolves():
    hostnames = Hostnames()
    ip = await hostnames.get_hostname("example.com")
    assert isinstance(ip, str) and "." in ip
    assert hostnames["example.com"] == ip
    assert "example.com" in hostnames.times


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_invalid_hostname_returns_none():
    hostnames = Hostnames()
    ip = await hostnames.get_hostname("doesnotexist.localdomain")
    assert ip is None
    assert "doesnotexist.localdomain" in hostnames
    assert hostnames["doesnotexist.localdomain"] is None


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_task_caching_for_same_hostname():
    hostnames = Hostnames()
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(hostnames.get_hostname("example.com"))
    task2 = asyncio.create_task(hostnames.get_hostname("example.com"))
    ip1, ip2 = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)
    assert ip1 == ip2
    assert "example.com" in hostnames.tasks
    assert isinstance(hostnames.tasks["example.com"], asyncio.Task)


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_getitem_triggers_lazy_resolution():
    hostnames = Hostnames()
    assert hostnames["example.com"] is None  # starts resolution
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    ip = hostnames["example.com"]
    assert isinstance(ip, str) or ip is None


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_times_dict_is_updated():
    hostnames = Hostnames()
    await hostnames.get_hostname("example.com")
    assert "example.com" in hostnames.times
    assert isinstance(hostnames.times["example.com"], float)
    assert hostnames.times["example.com"] >= 0


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_cancelled_task_removes_from_tasks():
    hostnames = Hostnames()
    task = hostnames.start_get_hostname("example.com")
    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
    assert "example.com" not in hostnames.tasks
```

👉 Notes:

* I used `pytest-asyncio` so you can run tests with `pytest -q`.
* For deterministic testing, you could **mock `loop.getaddrinfo`** to avoid hitting the network. Would you like me to rewrite the tests with **`unittest.mock`** so they don’t depend on real DNS lookups?

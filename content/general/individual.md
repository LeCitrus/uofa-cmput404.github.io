<!--
* CMPUT 404: Participation marks will be marked out of 8 points.
* At most one point can be earned per lecture.
* A point can be earned by answering an instructor's question during class.
* A point can be earned by asking a thoughtful question about the course material during class.
* Points can be earned either in-person or by participating over Zoom.
* Specifically no points will be awarded for asking/answering questions about the course itself, such as grades, submission requirements, due dates, etc.
* Additional opportunities may be added.
